Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	- All small parts for the main functionalities have been analyzed, designed and implemented
	- "jvc status" is 50% completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 6 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 30 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- (significant) Figured out a simplified way to create and store TREE and SAVE objects
- jvc status is 50% completed

Challenges:
- The next challenge is to figure out how to efficiently traverse the directory and follow the TREE object at the same time,
	while creating the appropriate COMMIT, TREE, and BLOB object. It is certainly doable, but what's the optimized way to do it?

Plans / Goals for next week:
- (PRIORITY) Finish jvc status using the algorithm desgined this week
- Implement the "tree index file" and the "save index file"
- (optional) Get started on implementing the "save" functionality.

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- I didn't spend a lot of time on the project this week because of big assignments in another class and a large amount of grading to do for my TA job.
- Need to set apart 3hrs/day again
