Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status: "jvc status" algorithm analyzed in details. Code for smaller components implemented.
		"jvc save" algorithm analyzed in details. Code for smaller componenets implemented.

Number of hours worked since last update: 15 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 24 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Figured out algorithm to quickly determine if a file has changed
- SHA1 hash algorithm implemented

Challenges:
- The SHA1 run time can be improved. Currently it takes a very long time to hash a file especially when it's a large file.
  If the project has a bunch of large files that are modified, it would take forever for "jvc save" to hash.
  Maybe a wise thing to do is to use a different THREAD for each file that needs to be hashed so that the hashing can happen concurently?

Plans / Goals for next week:
- (PRIORITY) Research methods to traverse through all files in current directory.
- Create data structures for SHA1 hash and "Diff" (a structure that allows for checking file's changes).

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

- Need to be more strict with my 3hrs/day schedule :(
