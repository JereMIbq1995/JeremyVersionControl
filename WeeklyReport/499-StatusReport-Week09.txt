Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	10/17 must-have requirements completed (But the most important and difficult ones are done. Other requirements are superficial)
	0/4 stretch requirements completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 20 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 90 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Finished "jvc save"
- Encapsulated all implemented functionalities to be object-oriented
- Encapsulated all helper functions into appropriate classes (object-oriented)
- Wrote the main function (entry point of the program which ties all functionalities together)

Challenges:
- If created trees are named based on indices instead of hashed content, space might be wasted to store duplicated trees only with different name.
  The challenge is to figure out a way to create tree content and then hash it to see if there's any difference between it and
  already existing trees.
- Figure out how to separate header files from .cpp implementations
- Figure out how to neatly compile the whole project using make file

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- (PRIORITY) Implement and finish "jvc history"
- (IMPORTANT) Get started on "jvc revert"

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- Everything will be done in an object oriented fashing from now on.
