Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status: Initial. Main functionalities analyzed and initially designed

Number of hours worked since last update: 3 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 9 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Finished project proposal
- I actually didn't get much done this week on the project itself because of a big interview that I had to prepare for.
  But I'm planning to spend about 25 hours next week for the project to make up the time I lost.

Challenges:
I'm still having the same challenges as last week:
The most difficult part as of right now is to figure out a way to traverse through all files in
the repository. It looks like recursion must be used to do so. However, I'm not exactly sure how
to do that yet. Further research must be done to figure this out.

Plans / Goals for next week:
- Research methods to traverse through all files in current directory.
- Research the sha1 hashing algorithm.

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- An extra 10 hours must be spent next week on the project to catch up
