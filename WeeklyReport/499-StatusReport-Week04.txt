Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	- All small parts for the main functionalities have been analyzed, designed and implemented
	- Small parts ready to be assembled into main functionalities

Number of hours worked since last update: 15 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 24 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- (significant) Figured out how to create a BLOB object from content of a file and then recreate the file using the same BLOB (circled)
- Cleaned up code for SHA1 hash and encapsulated all code related to hashing into a HashingUnit class

Challenges:
- The next challenge is to figure out how to efficiently traverse the directory and follow the TREE object at the same time,
	while creating the appropriate COMMIT, TREE, and BLOB object. It is certainly doable, but what's the optimized way to do it?

Plans / Goals for next week:
- (PRIORITY) Refine and implement the main code for the "status" functionality
- Finish planning how the version control database needs to be implemented.
- Figure out how to create the TREE and COMMIT object.
- (optional) Get started on implementing the "save" functionality.

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.
