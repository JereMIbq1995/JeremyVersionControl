Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	16.9/17 must-have requirements completed (The 0.1 is the formating of the history display that needs to be done)
	0/4 stretch requirements completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 7 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 102 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Fixed a bug in JvcDao that mess up when files have spaces in their names. This allows "jvc revert" to work correctly.
- "jvc status" now shows current Version
- "jvc save" now allows customized message as the 3rd argument
- Implemented "jvc history" (90% completed)

Challenges:
- Figure out how to organize header files and .cpp files.

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- (PRIORITY) Finish "jvc history" by making the history display looks nicer and with more details
- Clean up the code:
	+ Put appropriate comments in the code
	+ Maybe use a make file?
	+ Separating templates from implementation: Moving code implementations from .h files to .cpp files (not really important but this makes the code looks nice)

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.
