Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	- All small parts for the main functionalities have been analyzed, designed and implemented
	- "jvc save" (commit) successfully traverses through everything in the directory and create blobs, trees, and saves (commits)
	for every initial new file.
		This means that "jvc save" is about 50% completed.
		Once "jvc save" and "jvc status" are completed, the rest of the project will be much easier
	- I decided not to finish "jvc status" this week but move on to "jvc save" instead since its the functionality
		that creates the "blob", "tree", and "save" objects which "jvc status" will need to reference to do its job.

Number of hours worked since last update: 12 hours (all spent on the SRS doc)
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 57 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- This week has been a little crazy for me socially so I actually did not get any code written (T_T)
- 16 pages of SRS document is completed with great detail. It's pretty beautiful by the time I'm done. I hope you like it!

Challenges (Same as last week):
- The next challenge is to implement the other halves of "jvc save" and "jvc status", which require every file to be compared to its blob.
  This can prove a little challenging because if not implemented well, the run time might suffer quite badly.

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- (PRIORITY) Finish the other halves of "jvc save" and "jvc status"
- Organize code into a more object oriented style
- Complete the SRS document

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- Really need to get some new code written for jvc save and jvc status
