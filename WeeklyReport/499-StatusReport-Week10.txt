Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	13/17 must-have requirements completed (But the most important and difficult ones are done. Other requirements are superficial)
	0/4 stretch requirements completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 20 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 90 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Implemented "jvc revert" - 80% completion
- Encapsulated jvc revert in its own class

Challenges:
- Figure out how jvc revert works with ignore. Would reverting to a version mess with ignored files? If in the newest version a file
	is ignored, but in the version to be reverted to it is not ignored, what happens when the forward revert happens?
- Figure out how to organize header files and .cpp files.

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- Finish "jvc revert"
- (PRIORITY) Implement and finish "jvc history"

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- Everything will be done in an object oriented fashing from now on.
