Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	17/17 must-have requirements completed
	0/4 stretch requirements completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 5 hours
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 107 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
- Cleaned up some error messages
- Finished up the project
- Project completion interview

Challenges:
- As of the stretch requirements, since branching can be done by a revert and a save, I feel like it's not
  neccessary to implement a separated branching functionality. It can certainly be done, but would only make
  the whole project more complicated for new users, which is against the purpose of jvc from the beginnning.

- I chose not to implement merging functionality because first of all, branching is not implemented, and second,
  merging is really involved. It would take a lot of time to complete, and it would also undermine the purpose
  of making things simple that jvc has.

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- Show off the project to my peers and friends and ask for feedback :)

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:

- It's been a great semester and I've learned so much about how version control works, especially about git. I have also
been able to implement my own ideas on how a few things should work that's different from git. I was super cool to see
the growth and the accomplishments I've had while working on JVC. I'm proud of JVC and what it can do and probably won't stop
bragging about it for a while once it's completed. I'm excited to move on to something new.
