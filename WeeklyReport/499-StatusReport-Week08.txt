Name: Jeremy Duong
Project Title: jvc (Jeremy's Version Control)

Team Members: Jeremy Duong (Functional Analyst, Software Engineer, QA)

Overall Status:
	6/17 must-have requirements completed (But the most important and difficult ones are done. Other requirements are superficial)
	0/4 stretch requirements completed

Number of hours worked since last update: 13 hours (all spent on the SRS doc)
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 70 hours
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 200 hours

Accomplishments:
A lot of progress was made this week. The most important parts of the project are very close to completion
- Finished implementing the algorithm for "jvc status." Functionality ready for optimization and encapsulation.
- "jvc save" is 95% completed. Ready for testing and optimization.

Challenges:
- If created trees are named based on indices instead of hashed content, space might be wasted to store duplicated trees only with different name.
  The challenge is to figure out a way to create tree content and then hash it to see if there's any difference between it and
  already existing trees.

Plans / Goals for next week (Same as last week):
- (PRIORITY) Finish "jvc save"
- (IMPORTANT) Start encapsulating functionalities into classes to ensure code organization.
- Get started on "jvc revert"

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
- Keep up with my weekly report. Make sure to include specific progress towards goals set.
- Report the same thing to brother Manley.

Other comments:
- Really need to get some new code written for jvc save and jvc status
