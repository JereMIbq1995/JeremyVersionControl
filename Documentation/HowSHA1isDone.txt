Step 1: Initialize H to a 160 bits. This is totally up to your choosing, that's why different people
	doing the same SHA1 process produce different hashes.

Step 2: Break the message into multiple chunks of 512 bits in length. If message length is not a multiple
	of 512 bits, then add padding so that it is.

Step 3:	For each 512 bits chunk of the message, pass it to the
	compress function together with the previously calculated H to produce the new H.

		Compress( 512bits-chunk, Last-160bits-H ) -> New-160bits-H

	Repeat this until all the chunks have been iterated through.

Step 4: Return the last value of H that the compress function calculated. This is the hash or digest of the message.


How does the compress function work?

	- It repeats the same process of calculation on the chunk and H 80 times and
